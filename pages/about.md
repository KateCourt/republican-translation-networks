I am a historian and journalist with a special interest in the intellectual and cultural history of the English Civil War and its legacy in the British Isles and Europe. 

I completed my BA, MA and PhD at the University of East Anglia in Norwich working with J.C. Davis and Mark Knights (now Warwick) for my thesis on the republican thinker Henry Neville (1619-1694).

My first monograph, based on my PhD work, was published as *Henry Neville and English Republican Culture in the Seventeenth Century: Dreaming of Another Game* (Manchester: MUP, 2009). My most recent book looks at *The English Republican Exiles in Europe during the Restoration* (Cambridge: CUP, 2020 [PB 2024]). I am currently working on a new project on 'English Republican Ideas and Translation Networks in Early Modern Germany, c1640-1848'.

Before joining Newcastle University as a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellow in December 2020, I taught at the UEA, Queen Mary and Goldsmiths (both University of London), Potsdam University and Humboldt University (Berlin) in Germany and, most recently, across the road at Northumbria University, where I was a (Senior) Lecturer from 2011 to 2015.

I have also worked for various German media, including dpa International, the Catholic News Agency KNA, and the Network for Reporting on Eastern Europe n-ost, where I was responsible for the eurotopics press review.

Between April 2015 and November 2020, I worked as an editor for the German Press Agency dpa in Berlin.
